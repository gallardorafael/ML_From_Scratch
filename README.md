# ML_From_Scratch
Simple implementations of Machine Learning algorithms from scratch, pure Python.

Note: The code, comments and text in the Jupyter notebooks are in Spanish. I'll translate it in my free time. I'll also add more from-scratch implementations with time.

## Requirements
- jupyter notebook 6.1.4
- scikit-learn 0.23.2 (just to download some traditional datasets)

## Available implementations
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN_scratch)
- Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN_scratch)
