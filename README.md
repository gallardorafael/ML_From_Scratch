# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch
Simple implementations of Machine Learning algorithms from scratch, pure Python.

Note: The code, comments and text in the Jupyter notebooks are in Spanish. I'll translate it in my free time. I'll also add more from-scratch implementations with time.

## Requirements
I added a requirements.txt file with all the dependencies. To install, go to the root directory of the project and:

`
pip install -r requirements.txt
`

Note: I strongly recommend using a dedicated virtual environment for this project.

## Available implementations
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN_scratch)
- Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN_scratch)
